   <h1>Cryptocurrency</h1>
   <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly
   impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain
   technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies
   is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government 
   interference or manipulation.Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems.
   They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption
   algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private 
   key pairs, and hashing functions.</p>
